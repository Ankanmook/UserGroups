NLog

Razor Pages => functionality of Asp.net MVC Core

Run following command on UserGroup.Web

npm install 

Database 
  1.The database was built using SQL script and then EF scaffolding was done to generate the model which resides in UserGroup.DataModel along with Context 
  2.Database script in UserGroup.Sql => Creat.sql. It is idempotent (will delete and recreate DB (provided you don't have active connection to db) 
  3.Database backup is in the same folder 
  4.Database also contains search stored procedure and seeding of 2 groups and 5 person 
  5.Database version I am using is 14.0.2027.2 which corresponds to SQL Server 2017 In case you donâ€™t have SQL server 2017 installed THEN PLEASE run Create.sql and it should create an populate database for you.

Solution Architecture 
I decided to have 3-layer approach DAL Layer which has entity framework and dapper repositories Service Layer which has business logic UI layer which has Razor pages and Api controllers Reason for that was separation of concerns and testability. 
Each individual project can be tested separately and if removed then it should not affect the correctness of the system Liskov substitution principle
Api for Person and Group I decided to build the Api first for this page as I like Api driven approach (first build and test Api then views in this case) 
Advantage of building Api is that you can use that to build UI on single page application using something like React/Angular/Vue
Searching option has Entity Framework and Dapper Reason to include dapper is mentioned in SearchService.cs. I like Dapper
Once I build and tested them then I built the UI using Razor pages which are the new features introduced in asp.net core Finally I will focus on building the view component for search and pagination


Front End Npm 

Install For front end I have included package.json which builds and dumps the front end files to nodeModules directory Reason for doing that is I like using node.js to keep control of the files I am adding to my project 
Consequentially you can delete the files in wwwroot and it should still work as links to layout are directed from nodeModules
 If you publish this then it would build and put all the node files to nodeModules directory, provided you have npm installed

Person List View 
There are 3 views to list persons Page page Reason => it follows an incremental approach 
1.	Default View (No pagination) 
2.	Jquery Datatable View which gets all the data from back end and then does sorting and filtering on front end (inefficient)
3.	 Index View which has pagination and search option which only gets required filtered/paginated data from back end

What Next 
Build a View component for reusing the search option Use vuejs to build a front end which would also include building a search component which can be reused across 
Why choose vue because it is lightweight
